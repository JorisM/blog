######Game Idea (part 1)

The idea behind "Panem et Circenses" is a mashup between a TD and MOBA. There are two players facing each other, each with their own castle. Every 5 (or so) seconds, both players get one unit of gold. They can spend gold on spawning new minions. Minions will simply walk out of your castle and start attacking the enemy once in reach.

Each player also has one Hero. The player can freely move this hero and fight wherever needed most. 

The Hero will also be able to build towers, to help you defend against your enemy. Here a screenshot of early progress:

The main motiviation behind this project is to develop a game in F# with MonoGame. It will run on Windows. 

There will be a couple of blog entries following this one, from a simple setup in F# and Visualstudio (with MonoGame), to how the game is structured and many other things.
