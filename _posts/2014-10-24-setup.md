######Setup MonoGame in VisualStudio 2013 with F#: Idea (part 2)

To setup MonoGame with F#, setup a new F# Project (Console Application) in Visual Studio.
Add MonoGame as a NuGet Dependency (click on References -> Manage NuGet Packagesâ€¦ -> Search for MonoGame). 
You can delete Program.cs and Game1.cs files, as we will not be needing them. 

Once you've done that, start with two files, called Program.fs and Game.fs. Programm.fs serves as the Entry Point, whereas Game.fs overrides the required MonoGame methods.  For the code, go to:  

`https://gist.github.com/JorisM/83f007dd0c175b425e0a`

Make sure the order of your files is correct, Game.fs needs to above Program.fs in VS. 

Note that we load our Content folder with this line. 


```fsharp
do x.Content.RootDirectory <- "Content"
```


Make sure you have a Content folder in Project/Debug/bin, this is where all your assets (sprites, textures, etc) go that you want to access.  To automatically copy files when running your game, add something along the lines of 


```
echo D|Robocopy "$(ProjectDir)Content" "$(ProjectDir)bin\$(ConfigurationName)\Content" /E
set rce=%errorlevel%
if not %rce%==1 exit %rce% else exit 0
```


to the build events in your Project.

Alright, try to run your Game and see whether you see a blue screen. You have successfully laid your groundwork for your game;)
In the next part we will be reasoning about how to structure our game, and use our first assets. 


Part 3 is soon to come...:)
